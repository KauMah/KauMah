<!-- Introduction -->

<!-- Current Projects -->
<h2>ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/KauMah/GithubAnalyzer">Github Analyzer</a> - A Rust tool that clones all public repositories for a given user and scrapes data from each commit, concurrently cloning and deleting repos.</li>
  <li>A tool to help people stick with their new years resolutions</li>
  <li>Top Secret: Language Learning Application </li>
</ul>

<!-- Currently Learning -->
<h2>ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> - A systems programming language that can do so much more. I love its syntactical sugar, but it's forcing me to dig deeper to be able to properly use it all</li>
  <li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">Swift</a> - I'm learning swift so that I can leverage the CoreMIDI API in iOS to create a virtual MIDI controller with less latency than the existing wireless options.</li>

<!-- Fun Fact -->
<h2>âš¡ Fun fact:</h2>
<p>I love music, ranging from EDM to Indian classical. Once I'm employed, I'm going to sink a lot more time into music production and maybe even make some cool tools to make it easier!</p>
